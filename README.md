## How to try
It's important to be nice, but more important to have reproducible results.

1. Get a GitHub Copilot license.
2. Get data from Kaggle, see `data` folder.
3. Create a Codespace on main:
<img width="679" height="547" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5881608-6daa-4745-bcb7-07000d79ec3b" />

4. Wait a minute.
6. You are now reproducing results using VS Code in your browser.
